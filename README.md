# My Name search application

## Application Overview
  I have built an application which generates name suggestions for any entered keywords.The main
  objective of the application is that it provides a bunch of name suggestions to a user who is thinking 
  of a name for it's upcoming startup, venture or product. The application will suggest few names related to the keyword entered by the user and the user can select any particular name card. After selecting and clicking on it the user will be navigated to an URL which will show the availability and the charges of hosting the website.

## Steps to run

    $git clone {the url of the Github repo}
    This command will make a clone of the repo.

  2. Change directory into the new folder and type

     $npm install
     This will install the required dependencies

  3. To run the React Project

    $npm start    
    It will be hosted in http://localhost:3000/ and will display the application
