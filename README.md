# Application Name
My Name search application

# Application Overview
  I have built an application which generates name suggestions for any entered keywords.The main
  objective of the application is that it provides a bunch of name suggestions to a user who is thinking 
  of a name for it's upcoming startup, venture or product. The application will suggest few names related to the keyword entered by the user and the user can select any particular name card. After selecting and clicking on it the user will be navigated to an URL which will show the availability and the charges of hosting the website.

# Future plan
  I have some plans to include routers and make a single page application which can enable me to explore other ares under this name search hood
  like searching for Marketing Strategies, Selection of Tech Stack for the product, communicate with like minded people, asking for feedbacks and so on.
